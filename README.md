# OpenVibe: Source

Linux-first Source SDK 2013 multiplayer project for **OpenVibe: Source**.

- Public identity: `OpenVibe.Games`
- Source mod folder: `game/openvibe.games`
- Backend/API: `backend/`
- Tracked OpenVibe C++ patch sources: `sdk/openvibe/`
- VScript game logic: `game/openvibe.games/scripts/vscripts/`
- Editable maps: `hammer/vmf/`
- Compiled maps: `game/openvibe.games/maps/`
- API bridge sidecar: `tools/ov-sidecar.mjs`

## Current State

Implemented and tested locally:

- **Backend API** - Fastify/TypeScript with dev auth, Steam Web API ticket auth, player profiles, shop, inventory, server registry, travel tokens, match rewards, leaderboard, admin shop management, CDN asset manifest, and optional Redis-backed sessions.
- **Database** - PostgreSQL migrations for players, inventory, shop, servers, join tokens, currency ledger, and match results.
- **C++ GameDLL patch** - tracked in `sdk/openvibe/` and applied into the local Valve SDK checkout with `tools/apply-openvibe-sdk.sh`.
- **Authenticated travel** - `ov_join <mode>` requests `/v1/travel/request`, stores a join token in userinfo, and connects to the selected server.
- **Server-side arrival validation** - the destination server validates join tokens with `/v1/travel/validate`.
- **OpenVibe menu hooks** - VGUI commands `openvibe_menu` / `ov_menu` plus `resource/GameMenu.res` expose OpenVibe hub actions instead of relying on the stock server browser.
- **Prop Hunt C++ disguise command** - `ov_prophunt_disguise <model>` swaps the player to an allowlisted prop model; `ov_prophunt_reset_disguise` restores the player model.
- **Fort Wars C++ placement command** - `ov_fortwars_spawn <crate|barrel|fence|plate|concrete>` spawns allowlisted physics props during the build phase.
- **VScript game logic** - Squirrel scripts for hub, Prop Hunt, Deathrun, Fort Wars, and Traitor Town prototypes.
- **Portal maps** - generated VMFs and compiled BSPs use direct local connects for the current Proton fallback; set `OPENVIBE_USE_OV_JOIN=1` when generating maps for a rebuilt custom client DLL.
- **Sidecars** - tail SRCDS logs and bridge `[OV]` events to the backend API.
- **Production infra skeleton** - Docker Compose, Docker Swarm stack, and Kubernetes manifests for API, PostgreSQL, Redis, and CDN/static assets.
- **Hardening routes** - party invites, capacity-aware party travel, moderation/audit events, Prometheus-style metrics, and backup tooling.

Verified locally on June 28, 2026:

- `backend`: TypeScript build passes.
- `backend`: 11 Vitest tests pass.
- Source SDK 2013 Linux64 build passes with the OpenVibe C++ patch applied.
- SRCDS smoke test passes for all five maps: `ov_hub`, `ph_openvibe_dev`, `dr_openvibe_dev`, `fw_openvibe_dev`, `tt_openvibe_dev`.
- Full dev stack registers all five servers and returns travel targets for hub, Prop Hunt, Deathrun, Fort Wars, and Traitor Town.

## Commands

| Command | Side | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ov_join <mode>` | Client | Requests backend travel, stores join token, connects to target server. |
| `ov_auth_steam` | Client | Requests a Steam Web API ticket and posts it to `/v1/auth/steam`. |
| `openvibe_menu` / `ov_menu` | Client | Opens the OpenVibe VGUI hub menu. |
| `ov_open_url <url>` | Client | Opens OpenVibe web surfaces such as auth/inventory in Steam overlay/browser. |
| `ov_prophunt_disguise <model>` | Server | Applies allowlisted Prop Hunt disguise model. |
| `ov_prophunt_reset_disguise` | Server | Restores the normal player model. |
| `ov_fortwars_spawn <type>` | Server | Spawns allowlisted Fort Wars build props. |

## Quick Start

### Backend

```bash
cd ~/src/openvibe-source/backend
npm install
npm run build
npm test
```

### Build Source SDK GameDLLs

```bash
cd ~/src/openvibe-source
tools/build-sdk-linux.sh
tools/setup-openvibe-bin.sh
```

`tools/build-sdk-linux.sh` applies `sdk/openvibe/` into `engine/source-sdk-2013/`, patches the VPC files, and builds the HL2MP client/server Linux64 game DLLs.

### Full Dev Stack

```bash
cd ~/src/openvibe-source
OPENVIBE_SRCDS_MAP_DELAY=3 tools/dev-up.sh
```

This starts:

- PostgreSQL
- OpenVibe API
- Hub SRCDS
- Prop Hunt SRCDS
- Deathrun SRCDS
- Fort Wars SRCDS
- Traitor Town SRCDS
- one sidecar per server

Stop everything:

```bash
cd ~/src/openvibe-source
tools/dev-down.sh
```

### Smoke Tests

```bash
cd ~/src/openvibe-source
node tools/smoke-api.mjs
OPENVIBE_SRCDS_MAP_DELAY=3 OPENVIBE_SRCDS_SMOKE_TIMEOUT=45 tools/smoke-srcds.sh
```

### Maps

```bash
cd ~/src/openvibe-source
node tools/generate-dev-vmfs.mjs
tools/compile-dev-maps-wine.sh
```

Hammer++ is currently launched as a non-Steam game with Proton Experimental. The repo also keeps direct Wine launchers:

```bash
tools/run-hammerpp.sh
tools/run-hammerpp-wined3d.sh
```

Recommended Hammer++ paths through Wine:

```text
Game directory:
Z:\home\workstation\src\openvibe-source\game\openvibe.games

VMF directory:
Z:\home\workstation\src\openvibe-source\hammer\vmf

Map output:
Z:\home\workstation\src\openvibe-source\game\openvibe.games\maps
```

## Dedicated Server Runtime

The installed Source SDK Base 2013 Dedicated Server path:

```text
/mnt/6tb/ssd_offload/home/workstation/.steam/debian-installation/steamapps/common/Source SDK Base 2013 Dedicated Server
```

contains Windows server binaries in this environment. The working local Linux64 runtime is the TF2 dedicated server install at:

```text
~/srcds/tf2
```

`tools/run-server.sh` defaults to `~/srcds/tf2` and uses the OpenVibe mod directory at `game/openvibe.games`.

## Architecture

```text
Source client
  -> OpenVibe VGUI menu / launcher
  -> Steam auth ticket or dev auth
  -> OpenVibe.Games API
  -> Hub SRCDS
  -> portal pads
  -> Minigame SRCDS shards

OpenVibe.Games API
  -> PostgreSQL for durable game data
  -> Redis for sessions when configured
  -> CDN/static asset manifest for cosmetics
```

Gameplay remains Source-style authoritative SRCDS instances. The MMO-style part is the shared OpenVibe.Games account, inventory, currency, travel, and server orchestration layer.

Local Proton builds use direct portal connects so the maps work even when the Windows client DLL has not been rebuilt. The authenticated C++ travel path is still available by regenerating maps with `OPENVIBE_USE_OV_JOIN=1`.

## Production Configuration

Production auth requires:

- `STEAM_WEB_API_KEY`
- `STEAM_APP_ID`
- `OPENVIBE_ADMIN_SECRET`
- `DATABASE_URL`
- `SESSION_REDIS_URL`
- `OPENVIBE_CDN_BASE_URL`

Infrastructure templates live in:

- `infra/docker-compose.yml`
- `infra/production/docker-stack.yml`
- `infra/kubernetes/openvibe.yaml`
- `infra/cdn/nginx.conf`

Local database backups:

```bash
cd ~/src/openvibe-source
tools/backup-postgres.sh
```

## Remaining Work

The foundation is running. The next real work is content and hardening:

- Replace dev models/trails with real OpenVibe cosmetic assets.
- Add real hosted CDN storage behind `openvibe.games`.
- Wire Steam production credentials and app identity.
- Expand Prop Hunt, Deathrun, Fort Wars, and Traitor Town into full game rules.
- Add full admin web views, alert routing, and deployment secrets management.
